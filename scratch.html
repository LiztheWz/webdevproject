        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> 
            Fun fact: growing up, I was the designated desserts-maker in the family.
            So I guess you could say, I perfected the art of making cookies.
            My family's all-time favorite are banana chocolate-chip cookies.
            I can make a batch of 24 and they'll be gone halfway through the week.
            I didn't think they were THAT great until I went on my mission in Brazil.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Apparently, homemade cookies are a luxury. Brazilians will go crazy for chcolocate-chip cookies.
            And when you put banana in them, well they'll go insane and eat all of it. 
            Pretty soon, I was known as the missionary who bakes cookies. 
            I enjoy making people happy with food and desserts so here's my recipe!

                    bananas are preferable </li>
                <li> 1 tsp baking soda </li>
                <li> 1 cup of whole wheat flour </li>
                <li> 1 cup of unbleached white flour </li>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrennheit.</li>
                <li> Place the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk together. 
                    The mixture should reach an airy, fluffy, and soft texture as seen below. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        <span class="underline"> Warning:</span> 
                        If the butter is not at room temperature, it will not reach the desired consistency. 
                        Melted butter will result in a runny batter and expanded cookies.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Add the egg and vanilla to the butter and sugar mixture. Mix until the egg and vanilla are incorporated. 
                    Mixture should remain the same texture as before.</li>
                <li> Peel your bananas and discard the peels.</li>
                <li> In a small bowl, mash your peeled bananas. Beat until mixture reaches almost a liquid consistency and no big chunks are visible. </li>
                <li> Mix the baking soda in at this time and let the mixture sit for about 2 minutes. 
                    Enough time should be given for the acid of the bananas to react with the baking soda. 
                    This reaction allows cookies to rise when baking. </li>
                <li> Place the banana mixture into the large bowl containing the butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs. </li>
                <li> In a medium bowl combine the flour and salt. Optional: Add the oats and spices, then mix. </li>
                <li> Place the banana and sugar mixture into the medium bowl containing the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined. </li>
                <li> Add the chocolate chips (and nuts if desired) into the bowl and mix, keeping the same consistent texture. 
                    If unsure about your cookie dough texture, watch the following video. </li>

                <br>
                <li> Scoop heaping tablespoons of cookie dough and place onto non-stick baking sheets. 
                    Keep cookies approximately 2-3 inches apart as the cookies will expand when baking. 
                    It should make approximately 40 cookies.</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        <span class="underline"> Note:</span>
                        If non-stick baking pans are not available, regular baking pans are fine. 
                        Please make sure to apply a light amount of oil or butter onto pans before placing cookie dough.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Bake for approximately 10-15 minutes checking periodically. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        <span class="underline"> Note:</span> Older ovens may need 15-18 minutes to bake. </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span class="underline"> Caution:</span> Once reaching the 10 minute mark, check to see if cookies are baked by using the tip below. 
                        Continue checking up on the cookies every 1-2 minutes until fully baked. </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span class="underline">Tip: </span> To measure cookies’ baking status, insert a toothpick into a chocolate chip free area. 
                        If the toothpick comes out dry then the cookies are fully baked. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Once cookies are golden brown and bottom edges are noticeably darker (see picture below), carefully remove the pans from the oven using oven mitts, and let the cookies cool.</li>
